/**
 *  Here's the list of things that need to be done.

 *  Last updated by Moshe Berman on October 13, 2013

Documentation:
-------------

Maintainance:
------------
KCSefiraString needs to be refactored completely to emulate NSNumberFormatter or NSDateFormatter. The ideal would be an enum for ahskenaz/sefard format and a class that produces appropriate strings.
KosherCocoa.h needs to import only necessary headers, with documentation and all that.

Unit Tests - these classes need to be tested.
-----------
Sunrise/sunset methods in KCSunriseSuncetCalculator
KCComplexZmanimCalendar
KCZmanimCalendar
Holiday methods in KCJewishCalendar.
